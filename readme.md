<h1>Just Another NodeJS Library</h1>
<p>NodeJS library with general custom features and a focus on scientific programming for the web.</p><p>I feel that since HTML and web pages were originally created for scientific journals, there should at least be a dedicated web framework for scientific programming decades later during the boom of NodeJS Libraries and NodeJS Frameworks.</p>
<p>Currently creating object-oriented data structures in the library jHAM, and writing some naive algorithmic implementation of these objects. After the OODS's are complete, will add on to the library with some notorious algorithms.</p><p>From there, I will add some more applied algorithms to the library (applied to the scope of scientific programming). I will start with building out algorithms used in Physics (using/tweaking the then made OODSs) with JS.</p>
